1)what is React?

        * React is a open source web application.
        * It is a Javascript Library.
        * React is used to create reusable UI components,rendering of those components and handle the state of an application.
        * Initially it is called FaxJS
        * It was founded by Jordan Walke 
        * It is used in Facebook in the year of 2011,later on instagram in 2012.
        * In 2013,it is released in public.

============================================================================================================================

2)What are the advantages of react?

         * Virtual DOM
         * Component-based architecture
         * JSX
         * single page web application.
         * React Native
         * Flexibility
         * Speed and Efficiency.
============================================================================================================================

3)What is JSX?

         * JSX(Javascript XML) is a syntax  extension  for javascript commonly used with react.
         * It allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax ,directly within your javascript  code.
         * JSX makes it easier to describe the structure of UI components in react.

============================================================================================================================

4)What are keys in react?

        * In React,a key is a special string attribute that you need to include when creating lists of elements.
        * It is used to map over an array to create a list of elements,each element should have a unique key.
        * This allows react to efficiently update the UI by identifying which items have changed.

============================================================================================================================

5)What is React-Components?

        * In react,components are the building blocks of the user interface.
        * A react component is a reusable,self contained piece of code that encapsulates a specific functionality or UI element. 
        * A component is divided into two types:
                    * Function Component.
                    * Class Component.

============================================================================================================================

6)What is classcomponent and functioncomponent difference?

                                                            ClassComponent
															
															
         Syntax:  Defined as ES6 classes that extend 'React.Component'.
         State:   It has local state using 'this.state' and can update it using 'this.setState()'.
         Lifecycle Methods: ComponentDidMount,ComponentDidUpdate are used as a  lifecycle methods in class component.
		 
                                                            FunctionComponent
														  
         Syntax: Defined as javascript functions.
         State: State can be managed by using 'useState' Hook in function component.
         Lifecycle Methods:'useEffect' Hook is the lifecycle method used in function component.

============================================================================================================================

7)What is Constructor?

       * The constructor is a method used to initialize an object's state in a class.

       * It automatically called during the creation of an object in a class.

============================================================================================================================

8)What is super keyword?

       * In react,the 'super' keyword is used to call methods from the parent class(usually the base class or the class being extended)within a subclass component.
		
       * This is commonly used in the constructor to initialize the subclass before adding additional functionality.

============================================================================================================================

9)What is render function?

        * React renders HTML to the webpage by using a function called render().
        * It is a required function for all react components,and it is typically called whenever the component's state or props change.
        * The render function takes no argument and returns a react element.

============================================================================================================================

10)How to change of state value?

        * To change a value in the state object,use the this.setState() method.
        * when a value in the state object changes,the component will re-render,meaning that the output  will change according to the new value.

============================================================================================================================

11)What is the use of lifecycle methods?
       * React lifecycle methods are functions  that are called at different stages of a component's lifecycle.
       * They allow you to perform specific actions at different points in the component's lifecycle,such as initializing the state,making API requests 
          updating the UI.

============================================================================================================================

12)List of lifecycle methods?

         * Mounting : This phase occurs when the component is inserted into the DOM.The componentDidMount() method is called during this phase.
         * Updating : This phase occurs when the component's state or props change.The componentDidUpdate() method is called during the phase.
         * Unmounting: This phase occurs when the component is removed from the DOM.The componentWillMount() method is called during this phase.

============================================================================================================================

13)What is the use of useEffect?

         * The useEffect Hook allow us to perform the side effects in your components.
         * The useEffect runs by default after every render of the component.

============================================================================================================================

14)What are props in react?

          * Props is a object.
          * props are immutable.
          * props allow us to pass data from one component to another component.
          * props is mainly used in parent-child relationship.

============================================================================================================================

15)What is prop drilling in react?

        * props drilling occurs when a parent component passes data down to its children and those children pass the same data down to their own 
		 
        * children.This process can continue indefinitely.so we can use context for this process.

============================================================================================================================

16)What is React Hooks?

         * Before React 16.8 version,Function component cannot be used in state.
		 
         * After React 16.8 version,Function component is used in state using useState(Hook).

============================================================================================================================

17)What is React Hooks List?
              * useState
              * useEffect
              * useSelector
              * useDispatch
              * useReducer
              * useContext
   
============================================================================================================================   
			 
18)What are the different ways to style a react component?

         Inline style:
                  &ltp style={{backgroundColor:"blue"}}&gtWELCOME &lt/p&gt
        
        Internal style:
                  const heading={
                         textAlign:"center",
                         color:"pink"
                  }
                &lth3 style={heading}&gtHIII....&lt/h3&gt
             
        External style:
                 import './Home.css'
                 .head{
                        font-weight:700;
                        color:red;
                 }
                 &lth2 className=head&gtWelcome react&lt/h2&gt

============================================================================================================================

19)How do you handle the events in react?

            * we can handle the events by passing a function as a prop to an element like &ltbutton&gt.Event handlers must be passed,not called! 
			
            * onClick={handleClick} is defined by  an event handler function separately.

============================================================================================================================
  
20)How can you update the state of a component?

                                              Class Component
											

           import React from 'react'
           class Home extends React.Component{
                   constructor(){
                          super() 
                             this.state={
                                      name:"aruna"
                             }
                  const handle=()=&gt{
                           this.setState({name:"sankari"})
                   }
                  render(){
                  return(
                     &ltdiv&gt
                     &lth1&gt{this.state.name}&lt/h1&gt
                     &ltbutton onClick={handle}&gtUpdate&lt/button&gt
                     &lt/div&gt
                      )
                 }
          }
          export default Home
 
                                         Function Component
						

           import React from 'react'
           const Home=()=&gt{
               const[name,setName]=useState("aruna")
               const handle=()=&gt{
                      setName("sankari")
               }
               return(
                &ltdiv&gt
                &lth1&gt{name}&lt/h1&gt
                &ltbutton onClick={handle}&gtUpdate&lt/button&gt
                &lt/div&gt
                )
             }
             export default Home

============================================================================================================================

21)What is react router?

            * React Router is a routing library for react application.
            * It allows you to define multiple routes in your application and then handle navigation between those routes.
            * It enables the creation of single page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page.

============================================================================================================================

22)How to use of BrowserRouter?

            * A &ltBrowserRouter&gt stores the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URL's and navigates using the browser's
               built-in history stack.

============================================================================================================================

23)How to use of Routes & Links?

            Routes:
                   * It define routes in your application to map specific URL's to components.
                   * In react,you might use a library like  'react router'.

            Links:
                   * use links to navigate between different pages.
                   * In react,you might use the 'Link' component from 'react-router'

============================================================================================================================

24)What is the use of useParams & useSearchParams?

        useParams:
                  * 'param' typically refers to route parameters,which are dynamic values included in URL that are used to pass data or information to a specific route.
                   Eg:  "/Products/:id"

        useSearchParams:
                  * search param' refers to query parameters,which are typically used to pass additional information in the URL,usually after a question mark.
                  Eg:"/Search?q=react"

============================================================================================================================

25)What is React context?How to createContext?

           React Context:
		   
                 * React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

           createContext:
		   
                 * In React,you use the 'createContext' function to create a new context.This function returns an object with two properties: provider and 
                   consumer.

============================================================================================================================

26)What is the use of Provider & dispatch method?
           Provider:
                  * The Provider is a component or part of a state management system that allows its children to subscribe to a shared state.
  
           Dispatch:
                  * The dispatch method is often associated with state management libraries like Redux.

============================================================================================================================

27)What is read in context values?
             * Reading context values typically refers to accessing and retrieving the values stored in a react context.
             * In react,the 'useContext' hook is commonly used to read context values within  function component.

============================================================================================================================

28)How can we pass props from child to parent?

                        Function Component
        Child.js:

        import React from 'react'

            &ltParent n={x} ag={age} o={obj1} /&gt
        &lt/div&gt
                 )
          }
       export default Child

       Parent.js:
